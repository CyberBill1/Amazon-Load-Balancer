This Repo shows us the steps involve in creating an Amazon Load Balancer. 
Elastic Load Balancing automatically distributes your incoming traffic across multiple targets, such as EC2 instances, containers, and IP addresses, in one or more Availability Zones. 
It monitors the health of its registered targets, and routes traffic only to the healthy targets.
The following steps are required to achieve this on the Amazon management console after you have logged on

Step 1: Select a load balancer type
Step 2: Define your load balancer
Step 3: Assign security groups to your load balancer in a VPC
Step 4: Configure health checks for your EC2 instances
Step 5: Register EC2 instances with your load balancer
Step 6: Tag your load balancer (optional)
Step 7: Create and verify your load balancer
Step 8: Delete your load balancer (optional)
